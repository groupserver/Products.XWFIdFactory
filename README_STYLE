TEST CASES

	Please add unit tests for every method for which it would be reasonable to
	do so. See the 'tests' subdirectory for details. Always run the unit test
	code after adding a new method, and ALWAYS run the unit test code before
	checking in.

	Be liberal with adding test cases -- add test cases for gotchas, race
	conditions, boundary conditions and generally unexpected behaviour. If you
	have any sort of 'hunch' that an API may be changed in the future, add a
	test case to detect the change.

	If you need help to get the test harness running, please email
	richard@iopen.net.
	
API
 
	Do not modify an existing API without consulting the primary author for
	that class.
 
DOCUMENTATION

	All methods must have good docstrings, unless they provide absolutely
	trivial functionality. Remember that documentation or interfaces might be
	auto-generated from your code, and access to the internal workings of a
	method may not be available.

ATTRIBUTION

	Any 'borrowed' code MUST be attributed correctly. Failure to attribute code
	will result in the code being removed from the head -- obviously we do not
	want to risk breaching copyright!

CODE ACCEPTANCE

	New code will NOT be accepted into the HEAD without unit test coverage,
	nor will code be accepted which fails the unit tests. If a test is failing,
	either fix the broken code, or update the test.

	If you wish to test code, and version your tests, please test in your own
	branch, then merge into the HEAD. The HEAD branch _does_ consist of
	code in development, but it should be quality development code, which at
	the very least doesn't cause other developers to suffer breakages.

	The module owner has the final say on whether or not code is accepted into
	the HEAD of the main CVS repository.
