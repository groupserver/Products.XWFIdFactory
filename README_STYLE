 Please add unit tests for every method for which it would be reasonable to add a
 unit test. See tests/testXWFIdFactory.py for details. Always run the unit test code
 after adding a new method, and ALWAYS run the unit test code before checking
 in.
 
 New code will NOT be accepted into the head without unit test coverage,
 nor will code be accepted which fails the unit tests. If a test is failing, either
 fix the broken code, or update the test.

 If you need help to get the test harness running, please email richard@iopen.net.
 
 Do not modify an existing API without consulting the primary author for that class.
 
 Any 'borrowed' code MUST be attributed correctly. Failure to attribute code will result
 in the code being removed from the head -- obviously we do not want to risk breaching
 copyright!
 
 All methods must have good docstrings, unless they provide absolutely trivial
 functionality. Remember that documentation or interfaces might be auto-generated
 from your code, and access to the internal workings of a method may not be available.
